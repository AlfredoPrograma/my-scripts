# My Scripts repo
This is a very personal repository where I save most of my `scripts` that I use commonly thorogouth my applications and daily tasks.

# List of scripts
- `migrate.sh`: Wrapper script for `migrate` CLI tool Go programming language. It simplifies the usage of the tooling providing straightfoward commands which handles all needed flags behind de scenes.
